        to intercept a search without count with an order on is_user_favourite.

          * Finally take only a subset of those articles to fill with
            results matching asked offset / limit.

        Second step: fill with other results. If first step does not gives results
        enough to match offset and limit parameters we fill with a search on other
        articles. We keep the asked domain and ordering while filtering out already
        scanned articles to keep a coherent results.
